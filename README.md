 # Code Quiz

## Description

I created this code quiz for the DU coding boot camp. This was to educate me more about the functionality of JavaScript and I learned a lot along the way. This was designed to test JavaScript knowledge and to store and compare scores to other attempts. This shows who is the true JavaScript master. I learned the way you structure your html is very important when you are trying to make things happen with javascript. 

## Usage

To use this quiz, you'll first open the webpage. You'll click start quiz and will go through the multiple choice questions. When answered wrong, 20 seconds will be subtracted from the time. Once all questions are answered or the time hits zero, the score page will be displayed where you can enter in the initials. Initials must be entered before the submit button or play again button can be entered. Once submitted, you can click the high score button and a page will be displayed with all the stored high scores.
